# KPMG Technology Virtual Internship

## Data Analytics
> Helping companies understand their data

## Here is the background information on my task
Wondermarket is a German retail supermarket which has opened up 50 stores across the UK within the last 10 years. They are seeing a huge amount of growth, but as they are growing they are also spotting a lot of inefficiencies.

They have provided us with some datasets and it is my job as a data analyst to prepare, analyse, visualise and extract insights from the data, relevant to their expectations. The client’s expectations from this task are:

* They want to know which stores are performing best and which ones are performing worst
* They want to understand the regions with the largest opportunity for growth if they were to open a new store
* They want to understand what top 5 products they should sell in a new store to maximise profit when they first open
A large part of a data analyst’s job is to translate technical insights and concepts into relatable and understandable terms and outcomes for the client. Therefore, having a deep understanding of the data, the client’s business and their processes is important to complete this task.

## Here is my task
### 1. Business understanding
First, I should read through the company background document to gain an understanding of the client, Wondermarket, their business challenges and their business processes.

### 2. Exploratory data analysis
After this, I should start exploring the dataset provided. This exercise is for me to gain an understanding of their data, how it relates to their business, the statistical properties of the dataset and for me to start formulating how I can use the dataset to address the clients expectations.

### 3. Problem solving
Now I have a full understanding of the business and its data, it is now my job to extract insights from the data in order to address each of the 3 expectations from the client. In order to properly address each expectation, I may be required to aggregate or make calculations on the original datasets.

### 4. Presentation of results
Finally, I need to present the insights back to the client in a clear, concise and relatable format. To present my insights in the form of an executive summary slide, I use the additional resources for help when creating this slide.
